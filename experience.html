<b> <li><h3>  Perlis Indera Kayangan </h3></li> </b>

<p align="left"> <font face="comic sans ms"> ...My first and last experince in Kedah comes in 2017 as 
I go to Perlis-Thailand border called Padang Besar. I go there with my mother's school trip by bus.
Instead of my mother, I and my aunt go there. Padang Besar is a place that 
like a shopping complex with affordable price. Usually, based on what I listening to, 
people always go there to buy comforter. So, I also buy it. As it border with Thailand, then a 
Thailand-food is so delicious at there. Their tomyam pest also 
delicious. One day, I will definetely go there again.
<br>
<br>
...I also hope that after this pandemic, I can go there to explore the Perlis more as I heard that their smango named Harum Manis is so popular in there.
</p></font>

<b><li><h3> <font-face="comic sans ms"> Kedah Darul Aman </h3></li></b>

<p align="left"> <font face="comic sans ms"> ... First experience is when I in kindergarten. I do not remeber either 2006 or 2007 but I go to Muzium Padi as a trip. In there, theer is a space
that always rotate and I have a lot of fun in there. My second trip to Muzium Padi is on 2017 with my mother's school trip. It still give
the fun vibe and I get older, I can easily understand the display at there.
<br>
<br>
... I go to Kedah in 2008 as I attend my first and last outside-state camp called Bendang Man. I go there with my two cousins named Aisyah and Aini. 
At there, we swim in the river, hiking at nearest hill (only half) and others. To be honest, I dont remember my full trip except this two. Maybe, this two activities 
leave a great memories to me. In this camp, we need to sleep at tent. For me, this is a fun things to do.
<br>
<br>
... Kedah also my study's place as I study at <abbr title="Universiti Teknologi Mara">UiTM</abbr> Merbok. As I study in Kedah, I always go to Sungai Petani to shopping and ride a train back home.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
... MBI Kulim, I visit there in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Such a colorful, beautiful and happening place.

<b><li> <font face="comic sans ms"> <h3> Pulau Pinang Pulau Mutiara </h3></li></b>

<p align="left"> <font face="comic sans ms"> ... As this is my birth place and my homes, then of course I have a lot of memory regarding this state.
<br>

Escape Theme Park <sup> Adventure - fall in love with </sup> , Pantai Teluk Bahang <sup> Just rest and play the water </sup>, 
and Padang Kota <sup> ride the trishaw, round the place </sup>. This is my second trip in 2013. 
<br>
<br>

in my heart.
</font>
</p> 
<br>

<b><li> <font face="comic sans ms"><h3> Perak Indera Kayangan </h3></li></b>

<p align="left"> <font face="comic sans ms"> ... My experience in Perak are at Zoo Taiping and Museum Perak. I go there with a primary school's trip. I think
around 2010 or 2011. What I remember from this trip is my friends, teacher and I get a picture with 'Ular Sawa Batik'. I touch snake's tail in that picture. 
From this trip, I also have two cap with fan innovations and Museum Perak's keychain.
<br>
<br>
... In 2020, I frequently go to Selama, Perak to visit my cousin. My aunt and family go there to sleep over for 2 days and 1 night. In durian's season, we eat
the durian (fresh from tree). At Selama also, there is my first time experience in my life which is I got to go and swim in waterfall. I will 
never foeget this memories ever in my life.
<br>
<br>
... One day, I will definitely explore Perak more as it have so many hidden gem to explore.

<b><li> <font face="comic sans ms"><h3> Selangor Darul Ehsan & Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur </h3></li></b>
<p align="left"> <font face="comic sans ms"> ... I first go to Selongor is on 2010 to visit my cousin who stay there. I go to Selangor by bus. My cousin do bring 
my family to Aquaria, KLCC and others which I dont remember so much. 
 I think school trip's visit is on 2015, 2016 and 2017 by school trip. In 2015 and 2017, my memories go to I-City, Shah Alam. At there, my friends and I visit
the ghost house, go to 5D cinema, play the bump car and others. This is my best experience in Shah Alam. We also visit chocolate's factory.
<br>
<br>
... In 2016, I go there with among school-hostel's trips. My friend and I do represent my school. During this trip, we go to KLCC, Muzium Seni dan Budaya, and

The feeling is so different then by tarvelling with bus.
</font>
</p>
<br>

<b><li> <font face="comic sans ms"> <h3>Negeri Sembilan Darul Khusus </h3></li></b>

<p align="left"> <font face="comic sans ms"> ... I go there in 2015 as a school trip. The trip went to Melaka - Negeri Sembilan - Selangor. 
On our way from Melaka to Selangor, we take a little time to shopping at Nilai. From my experience, there is so many non-Malaysians who sell carpet and textile
at there. I do buy a clothes to my mothers. 
</font>
</p>
<br>

<b><li> <font face="comic sans ms"> <h3>Melaka Bandaraya Bersejarah </h3></li></b>

<p align="left"> <font face="comic sans ms"> ... Among to the other state, Melaka is my favourite ones. It is because as I love history so Melaka is a place who
full with its own history. I am still mesmerized by the how glamorous Malacca back then. In here, we can easily trace the history and be can see the beautiful 
Melaka. My first experience in Melaka is on 2011, when my family visit my father's cousin who staying at Malacca. Theird family took my family to visit the A Famosa,
Taming Sari Tower, palace and others. We also ride a trishaw.
<br>
<br>
... My second experience is on 2015 by school trip. Same as before, I also visited those place with addition such as Joker's Walk, trying their special asam pedas,
and others which I cannot remember at. My recent experience is on 2019 where I go with my family following my mother's school trip. We do visit the place
that I mentioned before as it is popular spot in Malacca. I will never got boring will all of this traveling to the same locations.
</font>
</p>
<br>

<b><li> <font face="comic sans ms"><h3> Johor Darul Takzim </h3></li></b>

<p align="left"> <font face="comic sans ms"> ... I have been to Johor with my family for the first and last time on 2011. We want to visit my father's cousin.
As well as we have been to Melaka, so why not just continue the journey to the Johor. In there, we staying at my father's cousin house and went to swimming at theirs
society pools. I almost drowned but alhamdulillah, luckily I'm saved. Later, we also visit Apollo's factories where we buy a bulk of three-layers-cake and Roka.
</font>
</p>
<br>

<b><li> <font face="comic sans ms"><h3> Pahang Darul Makmur </h3></li></b>

<p align="left"> <font face="comic sans ms"> ... At Pahang, I only go to two places which are Cameron Highlands and Genting Highlands. I went to Genting Highlands 
in 2011 with my primary school's trip. At there as it popular with it theme park, so we went there to play a lot of fun games. It such a good places that I am wishing
to go there someday. 
<br>
<br>
... I have been twice to Cameron Highlands which are on 2013 and 2017. In my first year at secondary's school, I go there with school's trip. We go there
to enjoy the tea hills, Brincang's night market, MARDI, Fraser Hill, and do a visit to BOH's factory. On 2017, my last year in secondary school, I go there with
hostel's trip. We do visit the same spots as it is an attraction at Cameron Highlands.  
</font>
</p>
<br>

<b><li> <font face="comic sans ms"> <h3>Terengganu Darul Iman </h3> </li></b>

<p align="left"> <font face="comic sans ms"> ... I go to this state is when I am 7 years old and with my aunt following my village's trip. We go there by busses. 
From what I remember, I do visit a batik's factory and thats all. Not so much to tell, but I think I do enjoy it a lot. If not because of pandemic, 
then in this year, 2020, I will go there with my family following my mother's last school trip. But it's okay about that. There will be another chance
for me to go there in future. Hopefully, InsyaAllah. 
</font>
</p>
<br>

<b><li> <font face="comic sans ms"> <h3>Kelantan Darul Naim </h3></li></b>

<p align="left"> <font face="comic sans ms"> ... Lastly, Kelantan. I have been to Kelantan twice in my life. First is on 2016. I go there with my hostel's trip.
At there, we do visit a Wakaf Che Yeh, Pasar Siti Khadijah, Kelantan's Palace, Batik's museum, Pantai Cahaya Bulan and others. It is such a good experience
as we all of the girls sleep in homestay that requires you to walk a few minutes to go to night market. As it homestay, so there are cooking's tools.
As Kelantan is popular with its Keropok Lekor, than senior and junior do take a turn to fry the Keropok Lekor, and later we eat together in evening.
It is such a memorable experience for me. 
<br>
<br>
... My seconds visit is on 2018 where I go there by car with my friend and his father's workers. As her father works at 
<abbr title="Pihak Berkuasa Kemajuan Pekebun Kecil Perusahaan Getah"> RISDA </abbr>, there are a courses that organized by them. As I know her and I am available 
when she ask me, so we go there for almost three days and two nights. At there, there are variabe of courses available and I got 'Teknik Perniagaan Secara Online' 
different from my friends. Although we stay at same house but we we stay at different room. I stay with two friends and unluckily for me, they are smoking.
So my among memorable experience at there is living in small room full of smoke smell. To be honest I dont like the smoke smell but even they're smoking, but
they are truly kind of people and easy to talk to. Besides we attend the courses, they also bring us to nights market in last night. There is also funny 
story yet sad is when we're on the way to Kelantan, we need to drive along Banjaran Titiwangsa (where there is a long driving but full of beautiful scenary).
We do not stop to eat before we drive to Banjaran Titiwangsa with the hope to eat at restaurant along the way. Unluckily, the restaurant is close so we just
take a rest and use the toilet only. Back to restaurant story, we need to strain ourself from hunger until we almost up to the courses's place.
